        <h3>Design Is the Product</h3>

        <span id="date"></span>

        <p>Here's a bunch of design quotes. People ignore design that ignores people. Creating an interface is much like building a house: If you don’t get the foundations right, no amount of decorating can fix the resulting structure. Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Design is knowing which ones to keep. The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution. When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong. The design is done when the problem goes away.</p>

        <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

            The ethos behind Quotebacks is one of the reasons why I love the product. Yes, it’s a great addition to my thinking toolkit, allowing me to store quotes without polluting my note-taking and thinking system. But it’s also a tool which aims at making the Internet a more generous place. If you regularly write online, give it a try!
